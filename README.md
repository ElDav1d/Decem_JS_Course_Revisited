# Decem_JS_Course_Revisited
The purpose of this repo is practicing by revisiting and improving some JS exercices from a course I did, not only with functionality but good practices and newer JS syntax.
Exercices will be grouped in folders containing the originals (including its initial statements, acceptance criteria and teacher's solution) and my personal approaches.
Course's main language was Spanish so it will also be user's interaction. But dev language will be English and version control will intend to follow the gitflow conventions.
